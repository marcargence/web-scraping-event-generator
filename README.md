## What is lxml?
lxml is a fast and light library for processing XML and HTML in the Python language.
the quickest way to install lxml is to use the system package manager, e.g. apt-get on Debian/Ubuntu:

```sudo apt-get install python3-lxml```

If your system does not provide binary packages or you want to install a newer version, the best way is to get the pip package management tool and run the following:

```pip install lxml```
